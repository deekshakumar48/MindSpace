# mind_space

Mind space assists you in identifying any mental health concerns you 
may have. It does so by allowing you to take a test that is easy and way of finding out based 
on the symptoms you may have. Our Questionnaire assists you in identifying the problem, and 
the resulting information directs you down the correct road to take, ensuring that you will find 
a solution. Your results may indicate whether or not you would benefit from treatment by one 
of our experts. Through motivational presentations and blogging, Mind Space also encourages 
people to improve their mental health. We also offer some advice and guidelines for living a 
better life.
